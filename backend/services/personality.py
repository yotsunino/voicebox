"""
Personality-driven text generation — lets a voice profile "speak" or "reply"
using an LLM that takes on the character described by the profile's
``personality`` prompt.

Three entry points:

- :func:`compose_as_profile` — zero-input, the character produces a fresh
  utterance. Wired to the "Compose" UI button (fill an empty generate box)
  and to the ``/profiles/{id}/compose`` endpoint.
- :func:`rewrite_as_profile` — takes user text, restates it in the
  character's voice while keeping every idea. Wired to the "Rewrite"
  button and the ``/profiles/{id}/rewrite`` endpoint.
- :func:`respond_as_profile` — takes user text and produces the
  character's reply to it (new content, not a rewrite). API-only via
  ``/profiles/{id}/respond`` and the ``/profiles/{id}/speak`` endpoint
  when ``intent="respond"``.

All three reuse the same local Qwen3 instance that refinement uses — no
extra model downloads, no extra warm-up. Temperature is tuned per mode:
compose runs hot (0.9) for variety, rewrite cool (0.3) for fidelity to
the user's ideas, respond mid-range (0.7) so the character feels alive
without drifting.

_CHARACTER_FRAMING = """You are roleplaying a specific character described below. Stay fully in character in everything you produce.

Rules that apply to every response:
- Do not break character. Do not explain what you are doing, refuse, apologize, greet the user, or acknowledge being an AI or assistant.
- Do not narrate action ("*smiles*", "(leans back)") or stage directions. Produce speech only.
- Do not wrap the output in quotes, code fences, or labels. Output the character's words and nothing else.
- Match the character's register — if they are curt, be curt; if they ramble, ramble; if they swear, swear."""
